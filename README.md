# Multi-Scenario-Pricing
Dynamic pricing algorithms have been widely studied to manage hotel and platform revenue over online travel platforms(OTPs). In contrast to conventional pricing problems, where a pricing strategy is only applied to some specific scenario, this paper proposed a multi-scenario pricing model with a novel sharing structure design that leverages cross-scenario and specific information to give both distribute prices and retail prices in the supply chain network, which allows the decision maker to simultaneously apply revenue management over the distribution network.
